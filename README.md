Final Flexbox project from [the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page) displaying a fundamental understanding of Flexbox. The goal is to recreate a landing page for a website based on a reference image, following along with font and colour guidelines, using flex as much as possible.
